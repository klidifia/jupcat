    <p>What started with a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/weremeow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@weremeow</a> showing his "soulmate cat chilling in Acropolis" ignited the birth of <span class="green">$JUPCAT</span> - the first memecoin in the Jupiter ecosystem. Hype quickly grew for <span class="green">$JUPCAT</span>. But the developer abandoned shortly after launch, selling all tokens and locking Telegram. While disheartening; this did not defeat <span class="green">$JUPCAT</span>! Passionate supporters swiftly regrouped and revived the community.</p>
    <p>This dedicated group aims to build an even better version of <span class="green">$JUPCAT</span> as the first community owned memecoin in the Jupiter ecosystem</p>
